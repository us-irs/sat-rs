The sat-rs book
======

This book is the primary information resource for the [sat-rs library](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/sat-rs)
in addition to the regular API documentation. It contains the following resources:

1. Architecture informations and consideration which would exceeds the scope of the regular API.
2. General information on how to build On-Board Software and how `sat-rs` can help to fulfill
   the unique requirements of writing software for remote systems.
2. A Getting-Started workshop where a small On-Board Software is built from scratch using
   sat-rs components.

# Introduction

The primary goal of the sat-rs library is to provide re-usable components
to write on-board software for remote systems like rovers or satellites. It is specifically written
for the special requirements for these systems.

It should be noted that sat-rs is early-stage software. Important features are missing. New releases
with breaking changes are released regularly, with all changes documented inside respective
changelog files. You should only use this library if your are willing to work in this
environment.

A lot of the architecture and general design considerations are based on the
[FSFW](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw) C++ framework which has flight heritage
through the 2 missions [FLP](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/flying-laptop/)
and [EIVE](https://www.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/en/research/satellitetechnology-and-instruments/smallsatelliteprogram/EIVE/).

# Getting started with the example

The [`satrs-example`](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/sat-rs/src/branch/main/satrs-example)
provides various practical usage examples of the `sat-rs` framework. If you are more interested in
the practical application of `sat-rs` inside an application, it is recommended to have a look at
the example application.

# Flight Heritage

There is an active and continuous effort to get early flight heritage for the sat-rs library.
Currently this library has the following flight heritage:

- Submission as an [OPS-SAT experiment](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/OPS-SAT)
  which has also
  [flown on the satellite](https://blogs.esa.int/rocketscience/2024/05/21/ops-sat-reentry-tomorrow-final-experiments-continue/).
  The application is strongly based on the sat-rs example application. You can find the repository
  of the experiment [here](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/ops-sat-rs).
